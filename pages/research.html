        <p class="description"> <strong>Improving the resolution and accuracy of cardiovascular phenotypes will lead to
            novel insights and
            therapies.</strong> This can occur by drilling down—understanding the genetic and cellular mechanism of a
          particular disease—or going broad, using computational means to analyze precision phenotypes at scale. Dr.
          Arnaout is currently developing computational methods to bring precision phenotyping to medical imaging. Her
          background as a physician-scientist informs the future scope of this work as a technology that can transform
          non-invasive imaging into a big-data tool for both research and clinical use. She also uses animal and in
          vitro models to study cardiovascular gene function and to model human cardiovascular disease.</p>
